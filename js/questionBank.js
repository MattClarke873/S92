fans in the LH and lower console are 100Watts

RH rack are 180Watts, with warning detectors

Signle fan fail?? Maint event

double fan fail? Cautions as follows Rack 1 fan fail, Rack 2 fan fail, Cockpit Sec fan

where would we locate the heater controller unit? Nose compartment

When can we have heating? APU or engines running

/* 
Loss of both ADCs sets a default ON time equivalent to -12°C

The slip ring is fitted with a duplex bearing and connected to the MDC.
If the primary bearing fails an advisory slip ring bearing is displayed.
The system can still be operated for a further 10 hours on the secondary bearing.

Power is distributed sequentially to each of the four corresponding span-wise heater elements in blades one and three then blades two and four.
Power is also distributed continuously to the four droop stop heaters.

if boths genrators fail and the a/c apu powered, which mats are heated? Number 2 only

when engine  engine 2 "anti ice degraded" caution?  Bleed air degraded with electrical still operational

if the heater element to the Left side fail? Pitot heat 1

if both generators fail and a/c powered from the APU? Overide switch will allow power to pilots side.

the pilots window heating system is powered from? No2 AC Pri bus for heating and No2 DC Primary bus for control

if the primary bearing for main rotor slipring fails? Slip ring bearing Advisory shown

when the rips system on the droop stops are heated ? when OAT drops below 5 deg c

selection of rips manual mode controls the main rotor heating elements in the ? off time only
